Yet another simple app. This app tracks your personal and business expenses and presents them using a simple user interface.

## Project plan and journey
#### Project Plan
The goal of this app was to further enhance my understanding of the important tools necessary for building a great application. The main goal was to understand how to store important user data and how to present data entered via a `TextField` into a list using a second UI page.

#### Journey
Making the first UI page and second UI page was not difficult however I stumbled across an issue, "How do I save user input so that when the user reloads the app at a later date, their data is still present". Enter `UserDefaults`, `UserDefaults` is an interface to the user's default database which stores key-value pairs persistently across launches of your app ([Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults)).

Essentially this interface attaches any type such as `Strings`, `Int`, `Arrays`  to a string name, usually referred to as a key. You use the same key to read data out of `UserDefaults`
For example, the sample code demonstrated here shows all this comes together 
```Swift
// Storing tapCount data into key called "Tap"
UserDefaults.standard.set(self.tapCount, forKey: "Tap")

// Reading data back
@State private var tapCount = UserDefaults.standard.integer(forKey: "Tap")
```
When working with complex or custom data types, Swift gives us the option to convert these types of data into plain text for archiving or unarchiving. In this app, we use the `JSONEncoder()` to convert our custom data type into a `json` format for archiving and `JSONDecoder` for unarchiving. 

## Topics covered
- `UserDefaults`
- `Codable protocol`
- `onDelete()`
- `@ObservedObject`
- `@Published` property wrapper
- `.sheet()`
